# Two Sharks
Two Sharks is a personal project inspired by one of my favorite mobile games, *Two Cars*.  
My sister and I played that game for years — we would consistently send each other screenshots of our high scores to see who could beat who. Eventually the original app disappeared from the App Store, and when she upgraded her phone, she lost access to the game entirely. Our long-running competition came to an unexpected end.

A few years later, for her birthday, I rebuilt the game myself with a spin on it featuring sharks instead of cars and released it on the App Store as **Two Sharks**.
It recreated the same core mechanic we loved, letting us finally compete again. To make it even better, I added an **online leaderboard system** with GameCenter so anyone with the game could join in and climb the rankings.

The base game was developed in **Unity**, and I used **Swift** to integrate online features and leaderboard functionality for the iOS release.

Although the game was later removed from the App Store for reasons Apple has never clarified (despite multiple support requests), both of us still have it installed — so the tradition continues!
